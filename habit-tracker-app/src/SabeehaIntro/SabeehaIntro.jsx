      <p>
        Hello, I'm Sabeeha. I'm a pharmacist by background and I'm based in London.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love reading and run a blog which is dedicated to all things book-related in my spare time: themodestbookshelf.wordpress.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been learning to speak Arabic for the last few months.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been learning to code for about a year now and have really enjoyed web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in particular.
      </p>
      <p className="emphasis">
        I'm looking forward to working on this project and learning how a functioning full-stack app is designed and built from scratch!
      </p>
